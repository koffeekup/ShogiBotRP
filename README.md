# ShogiBotRP

ShogiBotRP is an interactive Discord bot that enables players to log their Shogi games, track their performance using an ELO rating system, and display leaderboards. Designed for Discord servers, the bot provides a streamlined way to manage Shogi competitions with automated data storage and real-time updates.

## Features

### **Core Features**
- **Log Games:** Players can input the results of their games using the `!addgame` command. The bot guides users through the process with prompts, asking for:
  - Game result (e.g., winner/loser).
  - Player colors (e.g., black or white).
  - Additional notes (optional).
- **ELO System:** ELO ratings are automatically updated for both players after each game, factoring in the K-factor and game result.
- **Leaderboards:** The `!leaderboard` command displays the top players in the server, along with their ELO ratings.
- **Profiles:** Users can view their individual stats (e.g., total wins, losses, current ELO) using the `!profile` command.
- **Game History:** The `!history` command allows players to view their logged game history.

### **Admin Features**
- **Manage Players:** Admins can use commands like `!removemember` to delete players or `!elowand` to adjust ELO manually.
- **Role Assignment:** Top players are automatically assigned special Discord roles based on their leaderboard rank.

### **Planned Features (TBD)**
- Notifications and reminders for players.
- Backup and restore system for database storage.
- Customizable settings for the ELO system and leaderboard display.
